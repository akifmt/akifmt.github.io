Software projects are faced with the danger of failure due to improper use of resources, wrong prioritization and inaccurate understanding of customer demands throughout their lifecycle. According to The Standish Group&amp;rsquo;s 2009 Chaos Report, software projects fail at a rate of 68% worldwide. This has led large companies in Europe and America to try various methods to produce projects with higher productivity, and most companies have adopted Agile software development approaches, which they find most successful in management and practice.</description></item><item><title>What is Docker?</title><link>https://akifmt.github.io/posts/2016-11-24-docker/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://akifmt.github.io/posts/2016-11-24-docker/</guid><description>What is Docker Docker is an open source project that deploy application.

Problem: Raspbery Pi Remote Connection TR Keyboard Not Recognizing Solution: missing km-041f.ini file
Copy the km-041f.ini file to the /etc/xrdp/ directory on the Raspberry Pi. When xrdp is restarted, TR characters are no longer a problem.
The thing to note is that you must access the directory as root.
The step I followed; sudo pcmanfm on RasPi Copy the km-041f.ini file to /etc/xrdp/.
sudo service xrdp restart
Note: For those who have problems finding the file on the net, I downloaded it from this repo: Link</description></item><item><title>Application Sounds on Amazon AWS and Azure with Remote Desktop</title><link>https://akifmt.github.io/posts/2016-08-22-rdcileawsveazurevpsuzerindevacileses/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://akifmt.github.io/posts/2016-08-22-rdcileawsveazurevpsuzerindevacileses/</guid><description>Since VPS devices on AWS or Azure do not have a real sound card, it is not possible to receive sound on these devices.
