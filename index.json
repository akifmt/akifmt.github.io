It allows you to switch between different database providers, such as InMemory, SQLite, and SQL Server, based on the configuration settings.\nDatabase Provider: Refers to the type of database being used, such as InMemory, SQLite, or SQL Server.\nConnection String: A string that contains the necessary information to connect to a specific database.\nEntity Framework: A popular object-relational mapping (ORM) framework that simplifies database access in .NET applications.\nMigrations: A way to manage database schema changes over time, allowing you to update the database structure without losing data.\nDependency Injection: A design pattern that allows objects to be created and managed by a separate container, making it easier to manage dependencies between different components of an application.\nProgram.cs The code consists of two main sections: the Main method and the ServiceCollectionExtensions class.\nIn the Main method:\nIt creates a WebApplication builder. It retrieves the active database provider from the configuration settings. If a provider is specified, it configures the services and connection string for that provider. If the provider is InMemory, it checks and creates the database. It adds necessary services to the container. It builds the application and runs it. In the ServiceCollectionExtensions class:\nIt defines an extension method ConfigureServices for the IServiceCollection interface. It configures the ApplicationDbContext based on the specified provider and connection string. It adds services for SeedData and BlogPostService. It configures AutoMapper for mapping between different models. It creates a mapper instance and adds it as a singleton service. Here are some code examples to illustrate the usage of the code:\nConfiguring the services for SQLite provider:\nservices.ConfigureServices(\u0026#34;Sqlite\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Data Source=mydatabase.db\u0026#34;); Checking and creating the database:\nservices.CheckAndCreateDatabase(); Using the SeedData service to create initial data:\nvar seedData = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService\u0026lt;SeedData\u0026gt;(); await seedData.CreateInitialData(); appsettings.json The configuration settings for the Blazor application, including the database provider and connection strings.\n{ \u0026#34;DatabaseProvider\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;InMemory\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ConnectionStrings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;Sqlite\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;SqlServer\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Localdb\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; }, DatabaseProvider: This property specifies the default database provider to be used by the Blazor application. In this example, the value is set to \u0026ldquo;InMemory\u0026rdquo;, which means an in-memory database will be used. You can replace this value with the desired database provider, such as \u0026ldquo;Sqlite\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;SqlServer\u0026rdquo;.\nConnectionStrings: This property contains a collection of connection strings for different database providers. In this example, three connection strings are provided: \u0026ldquo;Sqlite\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;SqlServer\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;Localdb\u0026rdquo;. Each connection string specifies the necessary details to connect to the respective database provider.\nbuildschema.bat Creating a migration: dotnet ef migrations add Initial01 -c ApplicationDbContext --startup-project ./BlazorAppEFMultipleDBProviders --project ./AppMigrations/AppMigrations.Sqlite -- --DatabaseProvider Sqlite This command adds a new migration named \u0026ldquo;Initial01\u0026rdquo; to the specified context (ApplicationDbContext). It generates the migration files in the ./Migrations/Initial01 directory. The \u0026ndash;startup-project and \u0026ndash;project flags specify the startup project and the project containing the migration files, respectively. The \u0026ndash;DatabaseProvider Sqlite flag indicates that we are using the SQLite database provider.\nGenerating a SQL script for a migration: dotnet ef migrations script -c ApplicationDbContext -o ./AppMigrations/AppMigrations.Sqlite/Migrations/Initial01.sql --startup-project ./BlazorAppEFMultipleDBProviders --project ./AppMigrations/AppMigrations.Sqlite -- --DatabaseProvider Sqlite This command generates a SQL script for the migration named \u0026ldquo;Initial01\u0026rdquo;. The script is saved in the ./AppMigrations/AppMigrations.Sqlite/Migrations/Initial01.sql file. The flags have the same meaning as in the previous command.\nRunning the application with seeding: dotnet run --project ./BlazorAppEFMultipleDBProviders/BlazorAppEFMultipleDBProviders.csproj /seed This command runs the application, specifically the BlazorAppEFMultipleDBProviders.csproj project, with the /seed argument. This argument triggers the seeding of initial data into the database.\nConclusion Configuring multiple database providers in a Blazor application is essential when you need to work with different databases or switch between databases based on the environment. By using the provided JSON configuration, you can easily specify the desired database provider and connection strings for each provider. This flexibility allows your Blazor application to seamlessly interact with different databases, providing a robust and scalable solution.\nThis example demonstrates how to implement multiple database providers in a Blazor application using C#. By configuring the services and connection string based on the specified provider, you can easily switch between different databases. The code also shows how to use migrations and seed data to manage the database schema and initial data.\nSource Full source code is available at this repository in GitHub: https://github.com/akifmt/DotNetCoding/tree/main/src/BlazorAppEFMultipleDBProviders\n","date":"July 31, 2023","hero":"/dotnet/2023-07-31-blazor-ef-multipledbproviders/blazor_dotnet.jpg","permalink":"https://akifmt.github.io/dotnet/2023-07-31-blazor-ef-multipledbproviders/","summary":"Blazor Blazor Entity Framework Migrations with Multiple Providers This code demonstrates how to implement multiple database providers in a Blazor application using C#.

The application uses ASP.NET Core and Blazor authentication and authorization to control access to the blog posts.\nBefore diving into the code, let\u0026rsquo;s understand some key concepts related to Blazor:\nBlazor: Blazor is a web framework that allows developers to build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript. It enables developers to write code that runs on the client-side in the browser using WebAssembly or on the server-side using SignalR.\nASP.NET Core: ASP.NET Core is an open-source, cross-platform framework for building modern, cloud-based web applications. It provides a unified programming model for building web APIs, web UIs, and real-time applications.\nBlazor Authentication and Authorization: Blazor provides built-in support for authentication and authorization. It allows developers to secure their applications by restricting access to certain resources based on user roles or policies.\nRazor: Razor is a syntax for combining HTML markup with C# code in a single file. It is used in Blazor to create dynamic web UIs.\nThe code is structured as a Blazor component with a Razor markup file (.razor) and a code-behind file (.cs). The Razor markup file contains the HTML and Razor syntax for rendering the UI, while the code-behind file contains the C# code for handling events and data manipulation.\nList Posts (Index.razor) The code starts with the @page directive, which specifies the URL route for this component (\u0026quot;/BlogPost\u0026quot;). The @using directives import the necessary namespaces for using classes and services in the code.\nThe @inject directives are used to inject dependencies into the component. In this case, the IMapper, NavigationManager, and BlogPostService are injected. The IMapper is used for object mapping, the NavigationManager is used for navigation, and the BlogPostService is used for retrieving blog posts.\nThe \u0026lt;PageTitle\u0026gt; component sets the page title to \u0026ldquo;Index\u0026rdquo;.\nThe \u0026lt;AuthorizeView\u0026gt; component is used to control access to the content based on the user\u0026rsquo;s authorization. The Policy attribute specifies the policy required to access the content. Inside the \u0026lt;Authorized\u0026gt; block, the UI for displaying the list of blog posts is rendered.\nThe code checks if the blogPosts variable is null. If it is null, a loading message is displayed. Otherwise, a table is rendered with the blog post data. The @foreach loop iterates over each blog post in the blogPosts collection and displays the blog post\u0026rsquo;s ID, title, and content. The AuthorizeView component is used to conditionally render the edit and delete links based on the user\u0026rsquo;s authorization.\nThe \u0026lt;NotAuthorized\u0026gt; block is rendered when the user is not authorized to access the content.\nThe @code block contains the C# code for the component. The blogPosts variable is declared as an IEnumerable\u0026lt;BlogPostViewModel\u0026gt; and is initially set to null. The OnInitializedAsync method is overridden to retrieve the blog posts from the BlogPostService and map them to the BlogPostViewModel using the IMapper.\nCreate Post (Create.razor) Let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at some code examples to better understand how the blog post creation works:\nCreating the BlogPostViewModel:\nprivate BlogPostViewModel? blogPost; protected override void OnInitialized() { blogPost = new(); } In the OnInitialized method, we initialize the blogPost variable as a new instance of the BlogPostViewModel class. This class represents the data structure for the blog post.\nHandling the Valid Submit:\nprivate async void HandleValidSubmit() { var model = Mapper.Map\u0026lt;BlogPostViewModel, BlogPost\u0026gt;(blogPost); bool result = await BlogPostService.AddBlogPostAsync(model); if (result) NavigationManager.NavigateTo(\u0026#34;/BlogPost\u0026#34;); } The HandleValidSubmit method is called when the user clicks the submit button. It maps the blogPost object to the BlogPost model using AutoMapper. Then, it calls the AddBlogPostAsync method of the BlogPostService to add the blog post to the database. If the operation is successful, the user is redirected to the \u0026ldquo;/BlogPost\u0026rdquo; page.\nPost Detail (Details.razor) Here are some key code examples from the Blazor BlogPost Details page:\nRetrieving the blog post data:\nprotected override async Task OnInitializedAsync() { if (blogPost == null) { var result = await BlogPostService.GetbyId(id); if (result != null) blogPost = Mapper.Map\u0026lt;BlogPost, BlogPostViewModel\u0026gt;(result); } } In the OnInitializedAsync method, the blog post data is retrieved from the server using the BlogPostService.GetbyId method. If the result is not null, the data is mapped to a BlogPostViewModel object using AutoMapper and assigned to the blogPost variable.\nDisplaying the blog post details:\n\u0026lt;dl class=\u0026#34;row\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dt class=\u0026#34;col-sm-2\u0026#34;\u0026gt; @nameof(BlogPost.Id) \u0026lt;/dt\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dd class=\u0026#34;col-sm-10\u0026#34;\u0026gt; @blogPost.Id \u0026lt;/dd\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dt class=\u0026#34;col-sm-2\u0026#34;\u0026gt; @nameof(BlogPost.Title) \u0026lt;/dt\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dd class=\u0026#34;col-sm-10\u0026#34;\u0026gt; @blogPost.Title \u0026lt;/dd\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dt class=\u0026#34;col-sm-2\u0026#34;\u0026gt; @nameof(BlogPost.Content) \u0026lt;/dt\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dd class=\u0026#34;col-sm-10\u0026#34;\u0026gt; @blogPost.Content \u0026lt;/dd\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dl\u0026gt; The blog post details are displayed using an HTML definition list (\u0026lt;dl\u0026gt;) with rows and columns. The @nameof directive is used to get the name of the properties of the BlogPost class, and the @blogPost variable is used to display the corresponding values.\nEdit Post (Edit.razor) Here are some code examples from the provided code:\nBinding the blogPost.Title property to an input field:\n\u0026lt;InputText @bind-Value=\u0026#34;blogPost.Title\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;form-control\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; Handling the form submission and updating the blog post:\nprivate async void HandleValidSubmit() { var model = Mapper.Map\u0026lt;BlogPostViewModel, BlogPost\u0026gt;(blogPost); bool result = await BlogPostService.UpdateBlogPostAsync(id, model); if (result) NavigationManager.NavigateTo(\u0026#34;/BlogPost\u0026#34;); } Delete Post (Delete.razor) Let\u0026rsquo;s take a closer look at some code examples to understand the implementation:\nDelete Confirmation:\n\u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;Are you sure you want to delete this?\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt; Blog Post Details:\n\u0026lt;dl class=\u0026#34;row\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dt class=\u0026#34;col-sm-2\u0026#34;\u0026gt; @nameof(BlogPost.Id) \u0026lt;/dt\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dd class=\u0026#34;col-sm-10\u0026#34;\u0026gt; @blogPost.Id \u0026lt;/dd\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dt class=\u0026#34;col-sm-2\u0026#34;\u0026gt; @nameof(BlogPost.Title) \u0026lt;/dt\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dd class=\u0026#34;col-sm-10\u0026#34;\u0026gt; @blogPost.Title \u0026lt;/dd\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dt class=\u0026#34;col-sm-2\u0026#34;\u0026gt; @nameof(BlogPost.Content) \u0026lt;/dt\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dd class=\u0026#34;col-sm-10\u0026#34;\u0026gt; @blogPost.Content \u0026lt;/dd\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dl\u0026gt; Delete Button:\n\u0026lt;button class=\u0026#34;btn btn-danger\u0026#34; @onclick=\u0026#34;DeleteButtonClick\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Delete\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; | \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;/BlogPost\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Back to List\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Source Full source code is available at this repository in GitHub: https://github.com/akifmt/DotNetCoding/tree/main/src/BlazorAppAuth\n","date":"July 30, 2023","hero":"/dotnet/2023-07-30-blazor-authentication-authorization/blazor_dotnet.jpg","permalink":"https://akifmt.github.io/dotnet/2023-07-30-blazor-authentication-authorization/","summary":"Blazor Authentication and Authorization This example represents a Blazor application that allows users to view a list of blog posts.

This page displays a list of blog posts using a RadzenDataGrid component. We will go through the key concepts, code structure, and code examples to understand how this page works.\nBefore diving into the code, let\u0026rsquo;s understand some key concepts related to Blazor and RadzenDataGrid:\nBlazor: Blazor is a web framework that allows developers to build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript. It enables the development of single-page applications (SPAs) with the power of .NET.\nRadzenDataGrid: RadzenDataGrid is a component provided by Radzen, a popular UI component library for Blazor. It is used to display tabular data with features like sorting, filtering, and paging.\nAutoMapper: AutoMapper is a library used for object-to-object mapping. It simplifies the mapping process between different object types by automatically mapping properties with matching names.\nBlogPostViewModel: BlogPostViewModel is a class that represents the data model for the blog post form. It contains properties for the title and content of the blog post.\nBlogPostService: BlogPostService is a service class responsible for handling CRUD operations related to blog posts. It provides methods for adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving blog posts from the database.\nNavigationManager: NavigationManager is a Blazor service that provides navigation functionality. It allows us to navigate to different pages within the application.\nThe code provided represents the \u0026quot;BlogPost\u0026quot; page in a Blazor application. Let\u0026rsquo;s break down the code structure and understand its different sections:\nPage Directive: The @page \u0026quot;/BlogPost\u0026quot; directive specifies the URL route for this page. It means that when the user navigates to \u0026ldquo;/BlogPost\u0026rdquo;, this page will be displayed.\nPage Directive: The @page directive specifies the URL route for this page. In this case, the page is accessible at \u0026ldquo;/BlogPost/Create\u0026rdquo;.\nRadzenDataGrid Component: The main component on this page is the RadzenDataGrid. It is configured with various properties and columns to display the blog post data.\nUsing Directives: The @using directives import the necessary namespaces for the code to work correctly. We import the AutoMapper, BlazorAppRadzenCRUD.Data, BlazorAppRadzenCRUD.Models, and BlazorAppRadzenCRUD.Services namespaces.\nDependency Injection: The @inject directives inject the required services into the page. We inject the IMapper, NavigationManager, and BlogPostService services.\nPage Content: The page content is wrapped in a \u0026lt;RadzenStack\u0026gt; component, which provides a vertical stack layout for the elements.\nLoading Indicator: If the blogPostViewModel is null, a loading message is displayed. This is useful when the page is still initializing and fetching data.\nBlog Post Form: Once the blogPostViewModel is populated, the blog post form is rendered. The form is wrapped in an \u0026lt;EditForm\u0026gt; component, which handles form validation and submission.\nForm Fields: The form contains two fields: title and content. Each field is wrapped in a \u0026lt;RadzenRow\u0026gt; component, which represents a row in the form layout. The \u0026lt;RadzenColumn\u0026gt; components define the size of the columns within the row.\nInput Fields: The \u0026lt;InputText\u0026gt; components represent the input fields for the title and content. The @bind-Value attribute binds the input field to the corresponding property in the blogPostViewModel.\nValidation: The \u0026lt;DataAnnotationsValidator\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;ValidationSummary\u0026gt; components handle form validation. They display error messages if the user enters invalid data.\nSave Button: The \u0026lt;RadzenButton\u0026gt; component represents the save button. It triggers the form submission when clicked and has a success style.\nBack Button: The \u0026lt;RadzenButton\u0026gt; component represents the back button. It navigates the user back to the blog post index page when clicked.\nCode Block: The @code block contains the C# code for the page. It defines the blogPostViewModel property, initializes it in the OnInitialized method, and handles the form submission and navigation.\nList Posts (Index.razor) Now, let\u0026rsquo;s take a closer look at some important code examples from the provided code:\nLoading Data: private async Task LoadData(LoadDataArgs args) { isLoading = true; var result = await BlogPostService.GetBlogPostsAsync(filter: args.Filter, top: args.Top, skip: args.Skip, orderby: args.OrderBy, count: true); blogPosts = Mapper.Map\u0026lt;IEnumerable\u0026lt;BlogPost\u0026gt;, IEnumerable\u0026lt;BlogPostViewModel\u0026gt;\u0026gt;(result.Result); totalCount = result.TotalCount; isLoading = false; } The LoadData method is responsible for loading the blog post data. It is called when the RadzenDataGrid needs to fetch new data, such as when the user changes the page or applies filters. It makes an asynchronous call to the BlogPostService.GetBlogPostsAsync method to retrieve the data. The result is then mapped to a collection of BlogPostViewModel objects using the Mapper class. Finally, the isLoading flag is updated to indicate the loading state.\nNavigation Methods: private void NavigatetoCreate() =\u0026gt; NavigationManager.NavigateTo(\u0026#34;/BlogPost/Create\u0026#34;); private void NavigatetoDetail(int id) =\u0026gt; NavigationManager.NavigateTo(quot;/BlogPost/Detail/{id}\u0026#34;); private void NavigatetoEdit(int id) =\u0026gt; NavigationManager.NavigateTo(quot;/BlogPost/Edit/{id}\u0026#34;); private void NavigatetoDelete(int id) =\u0026gt; NavigationManager.NavigateTo(quot;/BlogPost/Delete/{id}\u0026#34;); These methods handle the navigation to different pages related to the blog posts. For example, NavigatetoCreate navigates to the page for creating a new blog post, NavigatetoDetail navigates to the page for viewing the details of a specific blog post, and so on. The NavigationManager class is used to perform the navigation by specifying the desired URL.\nCreate Post (Create.razor) Here are some code examples to illustrate the concepts discussed above:\nMapping the BlogPostViewModel to BlogPost:\nvar blogPost = Mapper.Map\u0026lt;BlogPostViewModel, BlogPost\u0026gt;(blogPostViewModel); In this example, we use AutoMapper to map the properties of the blogPostViewModel to the corresponding properties of the BlogPost model.\nAdding a new blog post:\nbool result = await BlogPostService.AddBlogPostAsync(blogPost); Here, we call the AddBlogPostAsync method of the BlogPostService to add the new blog post to the database. The method returns a boolean value indicating the success of the operation.\nNavigating to the blog post index page:\nNavigationManager.NavigateTo(\u0026#34;/BlogPost\u0026#34;); This code snippet uses the NavigationManager to navigate the user back to the blog post index page (\u0026quot;/BlogPost\u0026quot;) after a successful save operation.\nPost Detail (Detail.razor) Here is an example of how the code retrieves the blog post data and maps it to the view model:\nprotected override async Task OnInitializedAsync() { if (blogPostViewModel == null) { var blogPost = await BlogPostService.GetbyId(id); if (blogPost == null) return; blogPostViewModel = Mapper.Map\u0026lt;BlogPost, BlogPostViewModel\u0026gt;(blogPost); } } In this example, the GetbyId method of the BlogPostService is called to retrieve the blog post data based on the provided ID. If the blog post is found, it is then mapped to the BlogPostViewModel using AutoMapper.\nEdit Post (Edit.razor) Here are some key code examples from the provided code:\nBinding the input fields to the blogPostViewModel properties:\n\u0026lt;InputText id=\u0026#34;title\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;form-control\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;Title\u0026#34; @bind-Value=\u0026#34;blogPostViewModel.Title\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; The @bind-Value directive binds the value of the input field to the Title property of the blogPostViewModel.\nHandling the form submission:\n\u0026lt;EditForm Context=\u0026#34;editFormEdit\u0026#34; Model=\u0026#34;@blogPostViewModel\u0026#34; OnValidSubmit=\u0026#34;HandleValidSubmit\u0026#34;\u0026gt; ... \u0026lt;RadzenButton Text=\u0026#34;Save\u0026#34; Icon=\u0026#34;save\u0026#34; ButtonType=\u0026#34;ButtonType.Submit\u0026#34; ButtonStyle=\u0026#34;ButtonStyle.Success\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/EditForm\u0026gt; The OnValidSubmit event handler is triggered when the form is submitted and passes the form data to the HandleValidSubmit method.\nNavigating to the blog post index page:\nprivate void NavigatetoBlogPostIndex() =\u0026gt; NavigationManager.NavigateTo(\u0026#34;/BlogPost\u0026#34;); The NavigatetoBlogPostIndex method uses the NavigationManager service to navigate to the blog post index page.\nDelete Post (Delete.razor) The code example provided includes the following key components:\nRetrieving the Blog Post Details:\nprotected override async Task OnInitializedAsync() { if (blogPostViewModel == null) { var blogPost = await BlogPostService.GetbyId(id); if (blogPost == null) return; blogPostViewModel = Mapper.Map\u0026lt;BlogPost, BlogPostViewModel\u0026gt;(blogPost); } } This method is executed when the page is initialized. It retrieves the blog post details using the BlogPostService and maps the retrieved BlogPost object to a BlogPostViewModel object using AutoMapper. The blogPostViewModel property is then set to the mapped object.\nDeleting the Blog Post:\nprivate async void RemoveButtonClick() { bool result = await BlogPostService.DeletebyIdAsync(id); if (result) NavigationManager.NavigateTo(\u0026#34;/BlogPost\u0026#34;); } This method is called when the \u0026ldquo;REMOVE\u0026rdquo; button is clicked. It calls the DeletebyIdAsync method of the BlogPostService to delete the blog post with the specified ID.

This page displays a list of blog posts using a RadzenDataGrid component. We will go through the key concepts, code structure, and code examples to understand how this page works.\nBefore diving into the code, let\u0026rsquo;s understand some key concepts related to Blazor and RadzenDataGrid:\nBlazor: Blazor is a web framework that allows developers to build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript.","tags":["Dotnet","Blazor Radzen CRUD"],"title":"Blazor Radzen CRUD"},{"categories":["Dotnet","Blazor Radzen SearchComponent"],"contents":" Blazor Radzen SearchComponent 1. Blazor Radzen List Page The code provided is a Blazor component that demonstrates how to fetch data from a service and display it in a RadzenDataList component. It also includes a custom search component that allows users to search for specific blog posts.\nBlazor: Blazor is a web framework for building interactive client-side web applications using C# instead of JavaScript. It allows developers to write code in C# that runs on the client-side, eliminating the need for JavaScript. Radzen: Radzen is a set of UI components for Blazor that provides pre-built components for building responsive and interactive web applications. RadzenDataList: RadzenDataList is a component from the Radzen UI library that displays a list of items in a grid-like format. It supports features like paging, sorting, and filtering. RadzenCard: RadzenCard is a component from the Radzen UI library that displays content in a card-like format. It provides a visually appealing way to present data. ComponentSearch: ComponentSearch is a custom search component that allows users to search for specific blog posts. It triggers the search functionality when the user clicks the search button. BlogPostService: BlogPostService is a service that provides methods for fetching blog post data from a backend API. The code starts with the @page directive, which specifies the URL route for this component. In this case, the component is accessible at \u0026ldquo;/fetchdata\u0026rdquo;.\nThe code then includes the necessary @using directives to import the required namespaces and inject the BlogPostService into the component. The component\u0026rsquo;s markup is defined within the \u0026lt;PageTitle\u0026gt; tag. It starts with an \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; heading that displays the title \u0026ldquo;Blogposts\u0026rdquo; followed by a paragraph explaining the purpose of the component.\nNext, a \u0026lt;RadzenCard\u0026gt; component is used to wrap the search component. The search component is a custom component called ComponentSearch that is defined in a separate file. It is injected into the component using the @using directive and its SearchButtonClick event is bound to the SearchButtonClick method in the code section.\nAfter the search component, a \u0026lt;RadzenDataList\u0026gt; component is used to display the list of blog posts. It is configured with various properties like WrapItems, AllowPaging, IsLoading, LoadData, Data, Count, TItem, PageSize, PagerHorizontalAlign, and ShowPagingSummary. These properties control the behavior and appearance of the data list.\nInside the \u0026lt;RadzenDataList\u0026gt;, a \u0026lt;Template\u0026gt; component is used to define the layout of each item in the list. It contains a \u0026lt;RadzenCard\u0026gt; component that displays the blog post details in a card-like format. The details include the blog post ID, title, and content.\nThe code section contains the C# code that handles the data loading and search functionality. It defines various private fields and properties like itemPageSize, totalCount, isLoading, currentArgs, blogposts, search, and searchProperty.\nThe LoadData method is responsible for fetching the blog post data from the BlogPostService based on the provided arguments. It sets the isLoading flag to true, assigns the current arguments, and calls the GetBlogPostsbyPageAsync method of the BlogPostService. It then assigns the result to the blogposts field and updates the totalCount field. Finally, it sets the isLoading flag to false.\nThe SearchButtonClick method is triggered when the user clicks the search button in the custom search component. It updates the search field with the provided search value and calls the LoadData method to reload the data with the updated search value.\nHere is an example of how to use the RadzenDataList component in a Blazor application:\n\u0026lt;RadzenDataList Data=\u0026#34;@blogposts\u0026#34; PageSize=\u0026#34;10\u0026#34; AllowPaging=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Template Context=\u0026#34;blogpost\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;@blogpost.Title\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;@blogpost.Content\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/RadzenDataList\u0026gt; In this example, the RadzenDataList component is bound to a collection of blogposts and is configured to display 10 items per page with paging enabled. The \u0026lt;Template\u0026gt; component is used to define the layout of each item in the list, displaying the title and content of each blog post.\nThe provided code demonstrates how to fetch data from a service and display it in a Blazor component using the Radzen UI library. It also includes a custom search component for filtering the data based on user input. By understanding the key concepts and code structure, you can leverage this code to build similar functionality in your own Blazor applications.\n2. Blazor Radzen Search Component Here is an example of how the search component can be used in a Blazor application:\n\u0026lt;SearchComponent SearchButtonClick=\u0026#34;HandleSearch\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; @code { private async Task HandleSearch(string searchValue) { // Perform search logic here // Example: Call an API endpoint with the search query await SearchService.Search(searchValue); } } In the above example, the SearchComponent is used with the SearchButtonClick event callback. When the user clicks the search button, the HandleSearch method is invoked. Inside the HandleSearch method, you can implement the search logic, such as calling an API endpoint with the search query.\nSource Full source code is available at this repository in GitHub: https://github.com/akifmt/DotNetCoding/tree/main/src/BlazorAppRadzenSearch\n","date":"July 21, 2023","hero":"/dotnet/2023-07-21-blazor-radzen-searchcomponent/blazor_radzen_searchcomponent.jpg","permalink":"https://akifmt.github.io/dotnet/2023-07-21-blazor-radzen-searchcomponent/","summary":"Blazor Radzen SearchComponent 1.

Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms. (Source: wikipedia)\nObject Oriented Programming(OOP) Object Oriented Programming(OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods.\nEncapsulation Abstraction Inheritance Polymorphism There are five principles when design a class.\nSRP (The Single Responsibility Principle) A class should have one, and only one, reason to change. OCP (The Open Closed Principle) Should be able to extend any classes\u0026rsquo; behaviors, without modifying the classes.. LSP (The Liskov Substitution Principle) Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes. ISP (The Interface Segregation Principle) Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific. DIP (The Dependency Inversion Principle) Depend on abstractions, not on concretions. What is Encapsulation (or Information Hiding)? The encapsulation is the inclusion-within a program object-of all the resources needed for the object to function, basically, the methods and the data. In OOP the encapsulation is mainly achieved by creating classes, the classes expose public methods and properties. A class is kind of a container or capsule or a cell, which encapsulate a set of methods, attribute and properties to provide its indented functionalities to other classes. In that sense, encapsulation also allows a class to change its internal implementation without hurting the overall functioning of the system. That idea of encapsulation is to hide how a class does its business, while allowing other classes to make requests of it.\nIn order to modularize/ define the functionality of a one class, that class can uses functions or properties exposed by another class in many different ways. According to Object Oriented Programming there are several techniques classes can use to link with each other. Those techniques are named association, aggregation, and composition.\nAssociation A relationship where all objects have their own lifecycle and there is no owner.\nAggregation A specialised form of Association where all objects have their own lifecycle, but there is ownership and child objects can not belong to another parent object.\nComposition A specialised form of Aggregation and we can call this as a “death” relationship. It is a strong type of Aggregation. Child object does not have its lifecycle and if parent object is deleted, all child objects will also be deleted.\nAbstraction Abstraction is an emphasis on the idea, qualities and properties rather than the particulars (a suppression of detail). The importance of abstraction is derived from its ability to hide irrelevant details and from the use of names to reference objects. Abstraction is essential in the construction of programs. It places the emphasis on what an object is or does rather than how it is represented or how it works. Thus, it is the primary means of managing complexity in large programs.\nGeneralization Generalization is the broadening of application to encompass a larger domain of objects of the same or different type. Programming languages provide generalization through variables, parameterization, generics and polymorphism. It places the emphasis on the similarities between objects. Thus, it helps to manage complexity by collecting individuals into groups and providing a representative which can be used to specify any individual of the group.\nAbstraction and generalization are often used together. Abstracts are generalized through parameterization to provide greater utility. In parameterization, one or more parts of an entity are replaced with a name which is new to the entity. The name is used as a parameter. When the parameterized abstract is invoked, it is invoked with a binding of the parameter to an argument.\n","date":"July 1, 2023","hero":"/posts/2023-07-01-programming/blog18_Programming.jpg","permalink":"https://akifmt.github.io/posts/2023-07-01-programming/","summary":"Programming A programming language is a formal computer language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer.
