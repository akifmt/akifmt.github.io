The encapsulation is the inclusion-within a program object-of all the resources needed for the object to function, basically, the methods and the data. In OOP the encapsulation is mainly achieved by creating classes, the classes expose public methods and properties. A class is kind of a container or capsule or a cell, which encapsulate a set of methods, attribute and properties to provide its indented functionalities to other classes. In that sense, encapsulation also allows a class to change its internal implementation without hurting the overall functioning of the system. That idea of encapsulation is to hide how a class does its business, while allowing other classes to make requests of it.

In order to modularize/ define the functionality of a one class, that class can uses functions or properties exposed by another class in many different ways. According to Object Oriented Programming there are several techniques classes can use to link with each other. Those techniques are named association, aggregation, and composition.
