According to Object Oriented Design Principles, there are five principles when design a class.

- SRP (The Single Responsibility Principle) A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
- OCP (The Open Closed Principle) Should be able to extend any classes' behaviors, without modifying the classes..
- LSP (The Liskov Substitution Principle) Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.
- DIP (The Dependency Inversion Principle) Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
- ISP (The Interface Segregation Principle) Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific.
