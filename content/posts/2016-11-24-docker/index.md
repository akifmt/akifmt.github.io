## What is Docker

Docker is an open source project that deploy application. It works like a virtual machine, but better. Using a linux instance, it isolates itself from OS and works more secure.  Docker defines itself like that on official website;

> Docker containers wrap a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything needed to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries â€“ anything that can be installed on a server. This guarantees that the software will always run the same, regardless of its environment.
